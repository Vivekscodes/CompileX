Here are some small improvements to the code:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import CodeEditor from './components/CodeEditor/CodeEditor.jsx'
import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'
import Login from './components/Login'
import Register from './components/Register'
import HomePage from './components/Home.jsx' // Renamed for better clarity
import Navbar from './components/Navbar.jsx'

// Adding type hints
const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Navbar /> {/* No need to pass empty props */}
      <Routes>
        <Route path='/' element={<HomePage />} />
        <Route path='/editor/:id' element={<CodeEditor />} />
        <Route path='/login' element={<Login />} />
        <Route path='/register' element={<Register />} />
      </Routes>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

I have added comments, better variable names, and type hints. I have also simplified the logic by removing unnecessary props from the `Navbar` component. There were no bugs found in the code. The performance of the code is also good, so I didn't make any changes to improve it.
